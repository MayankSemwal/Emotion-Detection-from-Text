# Emotion-Detection-from-Text

Machine learning model that will identify the emotion of a given text using python libraries (such as Keras, Tensorflow, Pandas, Numpy, etc.)

There are two .csv files provided. One is a labelled dataset, and the other is unlabelled. Dataset 1 is labelled and has text along with nine associated emotions. Each data point is a text
with one or more emotions associated with it. Dataset 2 is unlabelled, and you can be as creative as you would like to use in a way you see fit. Your goal is to find different emotions in a text (sentence or collection of
sentences) that you have never seen.
